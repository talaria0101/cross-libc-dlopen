# Can each gate actually refuse?
#
# ⭐ A gate never seen to refuse is a gate nobody knows works. This plants the
# exact defect each gate exists to catch, runs the gate's own body UNPIPED,
# reads the exit code, and then runs the same body against a CLEAN tree.
#
# ⛔ BOTH HALVES ARE REQUIRED. A gate that refuses a planted defect and ALSO
# refuses a clean tree is not working, it is stuck, and two gates in this
# repository were exactly that when this script was first run, because each
# pattern matched the line of the workflow it was written on.
#
#   sh scripts/verify-gates.sh
#
# ⚠ It stages and unstages files under the repository. It never commits, and it
# restores the index on the way out, but do not run it over uncommitted work.
