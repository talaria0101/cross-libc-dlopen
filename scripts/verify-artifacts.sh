# THREE PROPERTIES, and each one fails silently if it is wrong rather than

#
#   SONAME        a forwarding shim whose SONAME is not the library it
#                 replaces still loads. ld.so simply never binds anything to
#                 it, so it forwards nothing and nothing says why.
#   export count  a shim exporting fewer entry points than its table declares
#                 hands some application `undefined symbol`, not at load,
#                 but at whichever call the missing one turns out to be.
#   max GLIBC_    an artefact needing a symbol version newer than the floor
#                 loads fine on the machine that built it and fails inside a
#                 bundle whose glibc is older. This is THE floor rule.

# ------------------------------------------ the preload versus the target --
# The FOURTH property, and it is about names rather than versions: the
# preload exports nothing the target's own libc family exports, beyond the
# two audited interpositions. An unversioned definition in a preload wins
# the lookup for a versioned reference, so any other shared name silently
# replaces the target's implementation for the WHOLE process. The
# __stack_chk_guard case is the measured one: on aarch64, riscv64 and
# loongarch64 the dynamic loader exports the name as the process-wide stack
# canary, the shim defined it as a function stub, chromium's GPU process
# died with SIGSEGV under the preload with the feature switch off, and
# x86-64 and ppc64le were untouched because their loaders never export the
# name (issue #37). The generator excludes it per architecture; this check
# re-measures the built object so an architecture added later fails here
# rather than in somebody's browser.
#
# The audited interpositions, exempt by name:
#   dlopen                      the point of the project
#   version-compat.c's forwarders deliberate, and each one forwards to the
#                               default definition it displaced

# ⭐ The endbr64 count, REPORTED rather than asserted. The trampolines spell
# their endbr64 as literal bytes in gl-fwd.c so the floor's assembler cannot
# be too old for them, and the build asks for no CET flag, so the count here
# should be the trampolines' own and nothing more. E101 in
# experiments/30-run-tests.sh is the case that keeps that true: the default
# recipe must produce strictly fewer endbr64 than the same recipe with the
# flag asked for. x86-64 only: CET is an x86 feature and the shims of every
# other architecture correctly have no endbr64 at all.
#
# ⚠ REPORTED, NOT ASSERTED: the .note.gnu.property IBT note, which is absent.
# The reason is measured. `-fcf-protection=full` emits no note on bullseye
# (gcc 10.2), bookworm (12.2) or trixie (14.2), because glibc's crti.o carries
# no property on any of the three, and the linker ANDs that absence across the
# link. ⛔ `-Wl,-z,ibt,-z,shstk` DOES emit one on all three, and the note it
# emits is FALSE: _init and _fini come from crti.o/crtn.o, ld.so reaches them
# through DT_INIT and DT_FINI, an indirect call, and neither begins with
# endbr64. Forcing the note would assert a property the object does not have,
# which is worse than not having the note.
# docs/report/09-the-second-boundary.md 9.13 has the full table.
