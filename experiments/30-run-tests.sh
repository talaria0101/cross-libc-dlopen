# Stage 3, running in Debian bullseye (glibc 2.31), standing in for "an AppImage that
# bundles an older glibc". Every experiment states its PREDICTION; the harness reports
# MATCH / MISMATCH against it. A MISMATCH is a finding, not a failure of the harness.
set -u
# ⚠ THE BOOTSTRAP IS NOT THE TEST, AND ITS FAILURE IS NOT A MISMATCH. All of
# this used to be `>/dev/null 2>&1`, so a container whose apt could not fetch
# the toolchain ran the whole table with gcc missing and reported 56
# MISMATCHes naming the cases instead of the cause. That happened: on the
# 2026-09-04 v0.2.3 tag run, the aarch64 runner's view of the bullseye
# repositories stopped working mid-day, and the discarded apt output was the
# only witness. The logs below made the cause readable on the next failure:
# deb.debian.org's bullseye-security POOL is being emptied while its indices
# still advertise the emptied versions, so `apt-get install` dies with 404s
# mid-download on some mirror edges and not others, because the edges cache
# differently. Measured: the pool directory for glibc carries only bookworm
# files while the bullseye-security index still lists deb11u14.
#
# So this stage takes its bullseye from archive.debian.org, which is the
# permanent home of an EOL suite and serves the whole of it (measured: the
# index, every package this stage asks for, and an InRelease that verifies
# against the keyring this image already carries). bullseye-security and
# bullseye-updates are dropped: the archive has neither, and the floor this
# stage measures is glibc 2.31 itself, not a point update of it. http, not
# https, because this image ships no CA store and apt's package signatures
# are the integrity guarantee. Check-Valid-Until is disabled because an
# archived suite is never re-dated; it is a no-op today and protective the
# day the archived Release file grows a Valid-Until.

echo "-- Q. libva's driver search: LIBVA_DRIVERS_PATH is ours to assemble"
#
# libva never dlopens its driver by soname. va_openDriver() walks a search
# list and dlopens the ABSOLUTE path it constructs from each entry,
# <dir>/<name>_drv_video.so. The list is LIBVA_DRIVERS_PATH, or the
# VA_DRIVERS_PATH compiled into whichever libva is running. That compiled
# default names the layout of the distro that BUILT it, so a bundled libva
# carries its build host's answer into a process on a different one. No
# library path can correct that, because no soname lookup ever happens.
#
# The feature under test: when libva.so.2 is in the process, the preload
# appends the host's <libdir>/dri directories to LIBVA_DRIVERS_PATH,
# behind anything already set, and touches nothing in a process that never
# loads libva. The bundle's own lib/dri is never added: a bundle that
# ships VA drivers manages this variable itself, and those entries already
# sit ahead of anything appended here.
#
# The fake libva below implements va_openDriver's CONTRACT: getenv,
# colon-split, constructed absolute path, RTLD_NOW|RTLD_GLOBAL|RTLD_NODELETE,
# dlsym __vaDriverInit_1_0. The fake drivers answer with the directory
# they were built for, so the verdict line names WHICH directory won rather
# than merely that a directory did. The answer round-trips through the
# driver's own function, so a pass is not "a string appeared".
